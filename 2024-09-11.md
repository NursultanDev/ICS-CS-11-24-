Today I'm gonna be a linux propagandist, and I will try to argue why linux is better than Windows 1000x times and then I suggest you the best linux distro ever.

So, about linux. Linux is a name for a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on a Linux kernel. The first version was released on september 17th 1991. I guess, you're wondering what's UNIX, UNIX is also a multi-user operating system developed by AT&T. Let's say that Linus torvalds was inspired by UNIX and created his own fast and reliable Linux. 
As we said before linux is a general name for a family of operating systems. Distributions are the part of the family, like a parent and child. 
There're three types of linux distributions, Debian based, rpm based, and Arch based distributions. Debian, RPM and Arch are the biggest giants distributions in the linux world, and other distributions based on them. 
We can see the Linux mint on a Live mode. It boots from the drive, and works there. It's a magic of a linux, lightweight and can run anywhere, on any shittiest machine ever, even on your potato.

The last words about linux, Everything what you see around beside the windows, is linux. IOS is linux, Android based on a Linux kernel and MacOS  based on a linux, it shows that Linux is the best OS ever, lightweight, optimized and fast. It took over the whole world. Servers, super comps and Smartphones, only PC weren't taken. So, I encourage you to use linux, that's all from me. Thank you.
